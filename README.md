Conway`s Life Game in python

## Conway`s Rules
1.   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.   Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.   Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Custom  Rules
1. If the map has no living cells, then game over.
2. If the number of living cells remains the same after 10 generations, then game over
